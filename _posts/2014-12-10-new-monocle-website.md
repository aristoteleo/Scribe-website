The Monocle project has moved to GitHub!  The repository for Monocle's source code lives [here](https://github.com/cole-trapnell-lab/monocle-release).  We welcome contributions from the user community. If you'd like to contribute, please make a pull request through the repository page. Monocle's website is now hosted through GitHub Pages.
